\paragraph{} The passage opens with the announcement of Edmund'd death.
This is followed by Albany announcing his intention to follow Lear for the rest of Lear's life. Albany finishes his lines by saying to Edgar and Kent, that `` all foes (shall taste) The cup of their deservings.'' This line is prophetic because right after Albany speaks, Lear mourns Cordelia and then dies. Albany's line leads the reader to interpret Lear
as a foe receiving what he deserves.


\paragraph{} Lear's line as he mourns Cordelia, does not flow well. Lear uses many words repetitively. These elements contribute to the sense of Lear's grief, he is so overcome, he cannot speak with the same degree of poetry as the other characters.


\paragraph{} After Albany says ``Bear them from hence... the gored state sustain'', Kent's reply is strange, he says he must follow his master, this would imply he intends to kill himself to follow Lear.
