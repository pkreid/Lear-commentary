\paragraph{} The passage opens with the announcement of Edmund'd death.
This is followed by Albany announcing his intention to follow Lear for the rest of Lear's life. Albany finishes his lines by saying to Edgar and Kent, that `` all foes (shall taste) The cup of their deservings.'' This line is prophetic because right after Albany speaks, Lear mourns Cordelia and then dies. Albany's line leads the reader to interpret Lear
as a foe receiving what he deserves.

\paragraph{} In this passage, Edmund is announced to be dead, Lear mourns Cordelia's death, and Lear himself dies. The death of Lear functions as a turning point in this passage.

\paragraph{} The packege is bookended by speeches by Albany. The contrast between his opening and closing paragraph shows the change in tone after Lear's death. Before Lear dies Albany says that the nobles must resign their power to Lear. After Lear and Cordelia die, he says they must obey sadness.

\paragraph{} After Albany says ``Bear them from hence... the gored state sustain'', Kent's reply is strange, he says he must follow his master, this would imply he intends to kill himself to follow Lear.
